## üõ†Ô∏è Linux Basics

### 1. Basic Linux Commands
Mastering basic commands is the first step toward Linux proficiency.

| Command       | Description                                |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `pwd`         | Prints the current working directory       |
| `ls`          | Lists files and directories               |
| `cd`          | Changes the current directory             |
| `cp`          | Copies files and directories              |
| `mv`          | Moves or renames files and directories     |
| `rm`          | Removes files or directories              |
| `man`         | Displays the manual for a command          |
| `chmod`       | Modifies file permissions                 |
| `chown`       | Changes file ownership                    |
| `echo`        | Displays text or variables to the screen   |
| `cat`         | Concatenates and displays file content     |
| `touch`       | Creates an empty file                     |
| `mkdir`       | Creates directories                       |
| `rmdir`       | Removes empty directories                 |

### 2. File Management
Managing files effectively is essential for organizing and maintaining a secure system.

- **Viewing Files**: Use `cat`, `less`, `more`, or `tail`.
  ```bash
  cat filename.txt
  tail -f log.txt
  ```
- **Editing Files**: Use text editors such as `nano`, `vim`, or `gedit`.
  ```bash
  nano filename.txt
  vim filename.txt
  ```
- **Compressing Files**:
  ```bash
  tar -cvf archive.tar file1 file2
  zip archive.zip file1 file2
  ```
- **Decompressing Files**:
  ```bash
  tar -xvf archive.tar
  unzip archive.zip
  ```

### 3. Package Management
Package managers are used to install, update, and remove software.

#### Ubuntu/Debian (APT)
- Update package list:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  ```
- Install a package:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install package_name
  ```
- Remove a package:
  ```bash
  sudo apt remove package_name
  ```

#### Red Hat/CentOS (YUM/DNF)
- Update package list:
  ```bash
  sudo yum update
  ```
- Install a package:
  ```bash
  sudo yum install package_name
  ```
- Remove a package:
  ```bash
  sudo yum remove package_name
  ```

### 4. User Management
- Add a new user:
  ```bash
  sudo adduser username
  ```
- Delete a user:
  ```bash
  sudo deluser username
  ```
- Modify user permissions:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG groupname username
  ```

## üìà Intermediate Linux Concepts

### 1. Process Management
Processes are running instances of programs. Managing them ensures system stability.

- View running processes:
  ```bash
  ps aux
  top
  htop
  ```
- Kill a process by PID:
  ```bash
  kill PID
  ```
- Kill a process forcefully:
  ```bash
  kill -9 PID
  ```

### 2. Networking
Networking commands are critical for managing connectivity, diagnosing issues, and ensuring security.

- View network interfaces:
  ```bash
  ifconfig
  ip a
  ```
- Test connectivity:
  ```bash
  ping hostname
  ```
- Trace network routes:
  ```bash
  traceroute hostname
  ```
- Scan open ports:
  ```bash
  nmap target_IP
  ```

### 3. Permissions and Ownership
Linux permissions dictate who can read, write, or execute files.

- Change file permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod 755 file
  ```
- Change ownership:
  ```bash
  chown user:group file
  ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Linux Topics

### 1. Shell Scripting
Shell scripting automates tasks, enhancing productivity and efficiency.

#### Example Script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Simple Backup Script
source_dir="/path/to/source"
dest_dir="/path/to/destination"

echo "Starting backup..."
rsync -av --delete $source_dir $dest_dir
echo "Backup completed!"
```
- Make the script executable:
  ```bash
  chmod +x script.sh
  ```

### 2. Security and Hardening
Securing a Linux system is paramount in cybersecurity.

- Enable and configure the firewall:
  ```bash
  sudo ufw enable
  sudo ufw allow ssh
  ```
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity:
  ```bash
  tail -f /var/log/auth.log
  ```
- Install intrusion detection tools:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install aide
  ```

## üõ°Ô∏è SIEM Troubleshooting Commands

### 1. Checking Log Files
Logs are essential for diagnosing issues.
```bash
ls -l /var/log/
tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

### 2. Debugging Log Ingestion
Verify logs are being sent to the SIEM.
```bash
tcpdump -i eth0 port 514
```

### 3. Restarting Agents
Restart agents to resolve configuration or connectivity issues.
```bash
sudo systemctl restart agent_name
```

## üîó SIEM Integration with Technologies

### 1. Cloud Integration
- **AWS**: Use CloudWatch Logs and Kinesis.
- **Azure**: Enable Azure Monitor and Sentinel.
- **Google Cloud**: Configure Stackdriver Logging.

### 2. Networking Devices
Forward syslog from routers, switches, and firewalls:
```bash
logging host SIEM_IP
logging trap informational
```

### 3. Applications
Integrate application logs (e.g., Apache, Nginx) with your SIEM.
```bash
sudo vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
access_log syslog:server=SIEM_IP:514;
```
